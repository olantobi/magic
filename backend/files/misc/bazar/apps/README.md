# Local Bazar

These are your local Bazar apps, that other Magic installations can install into their own servers
as they see fit. Each Bazar app can be found within a file with the following structure _"module_name-v1.2.3.zip"_,
where _"module_name"_ is the name of the module encapsulated by the zip file.
